## Komnenus Universalis Munistorum

The agency which acts as the face of this contract pack. Nothing more to it, just my
personal organization.

## Description

This contract pack was made after the desire for a reason to fly around kerbin and use
BD Armory's ordnance surfaced. The pack was inspired by KAF and DCA but is oriented
towards FAR compatible vehicles instead, it uses Contract Configurator for all the
agency's contracts.

The pack will feature many missions, locations will be spread all throught kerbin and
its moons, adding mission locations on other planets can be done upon request but i will
focus on the kerbin system first.
